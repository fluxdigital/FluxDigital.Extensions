# Sitecore Sloth

Sitecore Sloth is an open source Sitecore Module which prevents experience editor from scrolling the user up the page when adding new components, editing datasources and workflow etc. Having to scroll back down the page each time can be quite frustrating.

It’s been created as an Foundation Module following Helix conventions.

Please note it will only work on MVC based Sitecore sites and not Webforms ones as it hooks into the MVC rendering pipeline.

Thanks to Kamruz for sharing the original code and ideas.
